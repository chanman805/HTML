Two add-ons have been loaded into nuken for you: nuken Education handbook, and nuken Lesson Creation tool.
Slot 3 has been left open for you. You can also remove the pre-loaded add-ons if you would like, but nuken Education references the Handbook add-on in its code, so errors might arise from this. Also, there's no way to re-download the Education-only handbook on the Shop just yet, so be careful!
