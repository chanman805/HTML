To input your lessons into nuken Education, edit the contents of the "lessons.js" JS file as you like. A default template lesson has been started for you, simply fill in the blanks, or edit the file as you like.

You can also use the "Lesson Creator" addon; just copy/paste the output of the add-on to this JS file (it formats your lesson accordingly).

Feel free to create whatever folders or directory structure you like here. You can use this directory inside the "lessons.js" file via local file references.
