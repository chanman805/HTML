To input your lessons into nuken Education, edit the contents of the "lessons.js" JS file as you like. 
A default template lesson has been started for you, simply fill in the blanks, or edit the file as 
you like. You can also use the "Lesson Creator" addon to achieve this. Feel free to create whatever 
folders or directory structure you like here. You can use this directory inside the "lessons.js" 
file via local file references.
