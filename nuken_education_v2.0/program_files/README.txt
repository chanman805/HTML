Here's a little rundown of what you're seeing here:

"/addons" - This is where you'll extract your nuken Education add-ons to. More info on that inside.

"/images" - If you don't have any custom images to subsitute here, leave this folder alone. It's where
nuken Education grabs its interface from.

"/lessons" - This is where you'll extract your nuken Lessons to. More info on that inside.

"/styles" - If you don't know what this all is, don't touch it. It's necessary for nuken Education to
run, and contains things like the stylesheet, font files, and other essential info.

"feed.js" - Edit this JS file to include (or disable) your custom Educator Announcements Feed.
