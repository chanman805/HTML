Your educator has probably set you up with a collection of nuken Lessons. To access them, hover over the 
 <img src = "../../../../images/lessons.gif" width = "15px"></img> icon. You'll see a dropdown appear, with thumbnails
for each lesson. Click on the desired lesson to load it into nuken! 
<center>
<img src = "lessons.png" width = "78%"></img>
</center>

<p>
Once the lesson has been loaded into nuken, you'll find that you can edit the code in the boxes freely.
Follow your educator's instructions from this point onward (listed out in the nuken Lesson, or shared through conventional means).
