# nuken
nuken is an HTML file editor, with cross-platform and offline access. Edit and preview your webpages in the browser, use the link below to download the app!

This repository houses a few things for nuken to run, and some template nuken setups to get you started! However, we reccommend that you use the link to download nuken from our site, as this repository is for developers and tinkerers to just see how nuken runs. It's also for little things like version verification. nuken checks here to see if whatever version you're running is the latest build.

If you plan to actually use nuken and you're wondering where to start, it's here:

We appreciate your support!
